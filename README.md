# FlexenTech-Biometric-Watermarking

## Overview

This repository provides the complete implementation of our proposed watermarking pipeline described in the research paper:

**Title:** *Healthcare-Oriented Biometric Watermarking Framework Using FlexenTech and Logistic Maps*

This work introduces a robust, region-adaptive biometric watermarking system designed specifically for healthcare environments, integrating Local Binary Patterns (LBP), FlexenTech-based encryption, and logistic map–driven key generation for enhanced security and reliability.

## Key Contributions

- **Localized Feature Extraction:** The use of LBP for extracting texture features from fingerprint images enables effective compact biometric representation.
- **Flexible Encryption (FlexenTech):** An adaptable encryption module based on chaotic systems and secure transformations tailored for watermark data.
- **Intelligent Embedding Strategy:** Watermarks are inserted using a standard deviation–based region selection scheme to identify high-variance zones, enhancing robustness to distortion and attack.
- **Logistic Map Key Generator:** A lightweight chaotic system generates cryptographic keys for encryption and watermarking, improving unpredictability.
